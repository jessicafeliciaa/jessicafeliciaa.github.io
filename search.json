    "text": "🧾 Conclusion\nThrough the application of K-means clustering, we successfully identified five distinct customer segments for Sun Country Airlines. These clusters revealed meaningful patterns in booking behavior, travel timing, group sizes, and fare preferences. By segmenting customers in this way, the airline can personalize its marketing efforts, develop more tailored promotions, and optimize resource allocation for customer engagement.\nThis segmentation lays the groundwork for targeted marketing strategies, such as offering mobile booking incentives for younger travelers or loyalty perks for high-value solo fliers.\nThe process also demonstrated the power of combining raw Excel data with Python-based clustering and visualization tools to drive business insight. With scalable implementation, this approach could become part of a broader customer intelligence system at Sun Country."
