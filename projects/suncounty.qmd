# ✈️ Customer Segmentation for Sun Country Airlines

## 📌 Project Overview

Sun County Airlines, a small U.S.-based carrier, faces pressure from larger competitors. To compete effectively, the company needs a deep understanding of its customers’ behavior, demographics, and travel preferences. This project uses unsupervised machine learning to segment customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing and product development.

- Base Fare Paid
- Membership Status
- Product Type
- Route Details
- Group Size
- Booking Lead Time (days_pre_booked)
- Seasonality Habits

## 🔍 Methodology

We used **K-means clustering** after standardizing numerical features and encoding categorical ones. The **Elbow method** suggested that **k = 5** was optimal.

### 🧮 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
