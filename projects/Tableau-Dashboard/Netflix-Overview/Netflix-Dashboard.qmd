## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

Before visualizing the data in Tableau, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using Python:

- **Removed null values** in key fields such as `country`, `release_year`, and `listed_in` (genres).
- **Filled missing `date_added`** with a placeholder or dropped those rows, depending on completeness of other fields.
- **Extracted content type** (Movie vs. TV Show) and genre tags from multi-value columns.
- **Standardized text formatting** for categorical fields (e.g., lowercased, stripped whitespace).
- **Converted `release_year` and `date_added`** to datetime format to enable time-series analysis in Tableau.

All cleaning was performed in a Jupyter notebook using **Pandas**, and the final cleaned `.csv` was exported and used for Tableau dashboard development.

## 🔢 Key Metrics Summary

- **Total Titles**: 7,967 unique pieces of content  
- **Total Genres**: 17,588 (some titles span multiple genres)

These figures offer a snapshot of Netflix’s content volume and the movie-to-TV show ratio on the platform.

  - United States (4,993 titles)  
  - India (2,665 titles)  
  - United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea follow

## 📈 Content Growth Over Time

- Netflix’s content library grew significantly between 2015 and 2020, peaking around 2018–2019.
