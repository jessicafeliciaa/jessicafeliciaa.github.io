## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of social media advertising campaigns using a dataset that includes impressions, clicks, conversion rates, engagement scores, ROI, customer segments, and target audience demographics. We performed exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and created a performance dashboard in Tableau to uncover actionable insights.

## 📈 Predictive Modeling: High Conversion Classification

We created models to predict whether a campaign would achieve high conversion (`High_Conversion = 1`) using various features like CTR, CPC, engagement score, and demographics.

### Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

### Results Summary

| Model               | Accuracy | Recall (High Conversion) | Key Insight |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression| 54%      | 0.00                      | Failed to identify positive class |
| Decision Tree      | 52%      | 0.24                      | Some success identifying conversions |
| Random Forest      | 54%      | 0.02                      | Poor recall, reliant on CTR/CPC |

> **Note:** The overall accuracy and recall were low across all models, especially for predicting high-conversion campaigns. This was largely due to:

- **Class imbalance**: The dataset had a slightly uneven distribution of high vs. low conversion outcomes, which caused the models to favor the majority class.
- **Weak predictors (without CTR/CPC)**: When behavioral metrics like CTR and CPC were excluded, the remaining features (e.g., language, segment, audience) lacked strong predictive power.
- **High-importance behavioral variables**: CTR, CPC, and Engagement Score were the most influential features in identifying high-conversion campaigns. Removing them significantly reduced model effectiveness.

When using all features:

- **Top Predictors**:
  - CTR
  - CPC
  - Engagement Score

When excluding CTR and CPC:

- **Top Predictors**:
  - Language
  - Channel_Used
  - Customer Segment
  - Target Audience

### Dashboard Components:
- **KPI Summary**: Avg Engagement (4.37), Conversion Rate (8%), CTR (31.4%), Clicks (18,154)
- **Target Audience Effectiveness**: Shows normalized conversion, CTR, and engagement by age/gender group.
- **Campaign Goal ROI**: Product Launch campaigns had the highest average ROI (3.19).
- **Channel Performance**: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter had high CTR but varied in conversion performance.
- **Audience Segment Analysis**: Women 25–34 and Men 18–24 emerged as high-engagement segments across several customer types.


## 📌 Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Behavioral metrics** like CTR, CPC, and Engagement Score are the strongest predictors of conversion success.
- **Men 18–24** and **Women 25–34** are ideal target segments for conversion and engagement.
- **Twitter** performs best across CTR, conversion, and engagement — a top all-round ad channel.
- **Product Launch** campaigns deliver the highest ROI.
- **Future Strategy**: Focus on high-engagement audiences with performance channels (Twitter), optimize conversion paths on Facebook/Instagram, and use ROI heatmaps to guide budget allocation.
