## 📌 Project Overview

Sun County Airlines, a small U.S.-based carrier, faces pressure from larger competitors. To compete effectively, the company needs a deep understanding of its customers’ behavior, demographics, and travel preferences. This project uses unsupervised machine learning to segment customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing and product development.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Combine and clean customer datasets from Excel
- Identify key features relevant to customer behavior
- Apply KMeans Clustering to uncover unique customer groups
- Provide insights for strategic marketing decisions


## 🗂️ Data & Features

We used two spreadsheets from Sun County Airlines containing customer booking and demographic data. After merging the data using Pandas in Google Colab, we selected the following variables:

- Birthdate (Age)
- Booking Class & Channel
- Base Fare Paid
- Membership Status
- Product Type
- Route Details
- Group Size
- Booking Lead Time (days_pre_booked)
- Seasonality Habits

## 🔍 Methodology

We used **K-means clustering** after standardizing numerical features and encoding categorical ones. The **Elbow method** suggested that **k = 5** was optimal.

## 🧾 Conclusion

Through the application of K-means clustering, we successfully identified five distinct customer segments for Sun Country Airlines. These clusters revealed meaningful patterns in booking behavior, travel timing, group sizes, and fare preferences. By segmenting customers in this way, the airline can personalize its marketing efforts, develop more tailored promotions, and optimize resource allocation for customer engagement.

This segmentation lays the groundwork for targeted marketing strategies, such as offering mobile booking incentives for younger travelers or loyalty perks for high-value solo fliers.

The process also demonstrated the power of combining raw Excel data with Python-based clustering and visualization tools to drive business insight. With scalable implementation, this approach could become part of a broader customer intelligence system at Sun Country.

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional behavioral data such as frequency of bookings and flight satisfaction
- Explore supervised models for predicting customer loyalty or churn
- Build a dashboard (Tableau or Streamlit) for real-time cluster monitoring
