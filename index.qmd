### 👋 Welcome

Hi! I’m **Jessica Felicia**, a Master’s student in Business Analytics at UCI’s Paul Merage School of Business. I’m passionate about uncovering insights through marketing analytics, customer segmentation, and storytelling with data.

With a technical foundation and hands-on project experience, I love solving problems where **data meets strategy** — especially when it helps companies understand their customers better and grow smarter.
